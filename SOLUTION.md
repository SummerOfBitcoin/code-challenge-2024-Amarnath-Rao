# Summer of Bitcoin 2024: Mine Your First Block - Solution

## Design Approach

### Transaction Validation:
Transactions are validated based on several criteria, including but not limited to:
- Ensuring inputs are valid and unspent.
- Checking transaction format and structure.
- Verifying transaction signatures.
- Preventing double spending.

### Block Construction:
The block construction process involves:
- Creating a coinbase transaction with the mining reward.
- Selecting valid transactions from the mempool to include in the block.
- Constructing the block header, including the Merkle root of the transaction hashes.

### Mining Algorithm:
A basic proof-of-work mining algorithm is implemented, involving:
- Incrementing the nonce value until a valid block hash is found.
- Verifying the block hash meets the difficulty target.

## Implementation Details

### Transaction Validation:
- Implemented a function `validate_transaction(transaction)` to validate each transaction.
- Utilized various checks to ensure transaction integrity, including input validity, signature verification, and preventing double spending.

### Block Construction:
- Utilized functions `create_coinbase_transaction()` and `construct_block_header()` to construct the coinbase transaction and block header respectively.
- Mempool transactions were filtered for validity and included in the block.

### Mining Algorithm:
- Implemented a basic proof-of-work mining algorithm in the `mine_block(transactions)` function.
- Utilized a loop to iterate through nonce values until a valid block hash is found.
- Checked if the block hash meets the difficulty target.

### How to run:
To run the solution, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Place the `main.py` script in a directory.
   - Create a folder named `mempool` in the same directory.
   - Place the JSON files representing transactions in the `mempool` folder.

3. **Execute the Script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     python main.py
     bash run.sh
     ```

4. **Verify Output**:
   - Once the script finishes execution, check the `output.txt` file generated in the same directory.
   - Verify that it contains the block header, serialized coinbase transaction, and transaction IDs of mined transactions, as per the specified format.

By following these steps, you'll be able to run the solution and generate the output file successfully.

## Results and Performance

### Results:
- The solution successfully mined a block with valid transactions.
- The output.txt file was generated as per the specified format, containing the block header, coinbase transaction, and transaction IDs.

### Performance:
- The solution efficiently processed transactions and mined the block within a reasonable timeframe.
- Further optimization could be explored for larger transaction volumes.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the solution effectively addressed the challenge requirements by simulating the mining process of a block. Key components including transaction validation, block construction, and mining were implemented. The solution meets the criteria for correctness, code quality, and efficiency outlined in the challenge. Areas for future improvement include optimization for larger transaction volumes and enhancing the mining algorithm for better performance.
